# Document Extractor Agent A2A Communication Fixes

## Issues Found:

1. **Rate Limit Issue**: The free OpenRouter model has hit its rate limit
   - Error: "Rate limit exceeded: free-models-per-day"
   - Solution: Either add credits or switch to a different model

2. **Logging Added**: Successfully added detailed logging to track A2A communication
   - Logs show when tasks are received
   - Logs show the processing steps
   - Logs show the response being sent

3. **A2A Server Setup**: The agent is properly set up as an A2A server
   - Running on port 10001
   - Health endpoint responds correctly
   - Has proper handle_task implementation

4. **Code Structure**: The agent follows the correct pattern
   - Inherits from A2AServer
   - Has @agent decorator
   - Has @skill decorator for extract_documentation
   - Implements handle_task method

## To Fix the A2A Communication:

1. **Change the model** in `doc_extrator.py` from the rate-limited free model to another one:
   ```python
   llm = LLM(
       model="openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat-v3-0324:free",  # This is rate limited
       # Change to a different model or add API credits
   )
   ```

2. **Test with a mock response** to verify A2A communication works without hitting the LLM

3. **Verify the root agent** can communicate once the model issue is resolved

## Testing Steps:

1. Update the model configuration in `doc_extrator.py`
2. Restart the document_extractor agent: `python -m agents.document_extrator.agent`
3. Restart the root agent: `python -m agents.root_agent.agent`
4. Send a test request to the root agent
5. Check the logs to see if the communication flows properly

## Current Status:

- ✅ Agent structure is correct
- ✅ Logging is in place
- ✅ A2A server is running
- ❌ Model is rate limited
- ❓ A2A communication (pending model fix)
